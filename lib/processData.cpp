	WORKFLOW:

	1. Process the ingredients from the product-data dir
		- Create an diseases.txt file containing the diseases
		  in a shuffled format (they can't be ordered or the ternary tree
		  created will just be linked list)

	2. Read the diseasesShuffled.txt into a ternary tree, this will be used to search
	   ./text-data/PMC000xxxxxx/....txt and tag them accordingly

	3. Finally the tagging algorithm will be broken down into 4 main pieces

		a. TOKENISE LINES
			- Read the document in, it will need to be written out to the same file
			  but in a different dir.
			- Each line will need to be tokenised and punctuation stripped from it...

		b. SEARCH TOKENISED LINE
			- The tokenised line can then be looped over and each token searched for
			  in the ternary tree

		c. ADD TOKENS WHICH ARE DISEASES TO DICTIONARY<ingredient, [lines...]>
			- If the tokenised line has an "ingredient" in it, then we can add the
			  ingredient to a dict
			- This dict will be the ingredient and a list of lines that it occurs on...
				- This has the potential to be more fine grained (i.e. line number, position of starting character etc...)

		d. TAG
			- The document can then be tagged with the above dictionary...
			- Not to sure about this step yet...
			- alternatively a final data structure can be created with the following:
			{
				"documentid1":[
					{
						"ingredient1": [lines...]
					},
					{
						"ingredient2": [lines...]
					},
					etc...
				],
				"documentid2": [
					{
						"ingredient1": [lines...]
					},
					{
						"ingredient2": [lines...]
					}
				]
			}

						 appended to them)

        We can make use of the 'algorithm' library
